AWS Budget is a service that allows you to track and take action on the cost and usage of your resources.
There are four types of budgets but we will be creating a cost budget.

Steps to Create a Cost Budget

Sign in to the AWS Management Console, search and open the AWS Cost Management.

In Cost Management, Select Budgets then Click on Create budget at the top of the page.

Select Cost budget as type and then choose Next.

Under Period, choose how often you want the budget to count. You can select daily, monthly, etc. I'd be going with Monthly. 

For a Budget effective date, Select Recurring budget if you want a budget that resets after the budget period. Or, select Expiring budget if you want a budget that doesn't reset after the budget period.

Choose a start date for the start of your budget tracking, For an Expiring budget, choose the date when the tracking should end. 


The budgeting method determines which budget amount is used for tracking each period. I'd be going with it because I'd used the same budget amount every period.

Under Details, write the name of your budget, it must be a unique name in your account.

Under Alert Threshold, select an amount that must be reached before you're notified. It can be an absolute value or a percentage of your budgeted amount.

Under Notification, input the email address of the recipient of an alert when the threshold is exceeded.

For Actions, you can choose an action that should be taken when the threshold has been exceeded.

Review your budget and create.
