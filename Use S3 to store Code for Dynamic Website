Host a dynamic website on EC2
S3 can be used to store code to be used by the backend server. To do this, the source code will be uploaded to S3. EC2 will be configured at launch with the script to install server software and with the IAM Role to access S3. Users can then access the dynamic website through the public URL of the EC2 instance. 

Steps 1
