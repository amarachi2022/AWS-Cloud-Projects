Create IAM User 

An IAM user is created in an AWS account to grant access to AWS services and resources. I will create an IAM user through AWS Management Console.

Steps
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console

Choose Users and then Add users.

Put in a name for the User. You can also add up to 10 users at one time. User names must be unique within an account and are not case-sensitive.

Choose the Access type
Programmatic access is needed for signing into AWSCLI and SDK

AWS Management Console access is preferred if the users require access to the AWS Management Console. 
I'd be going with the latter.

Choose a password for the User. It can be autogenerated or Custom. I'd create a Customer password for the User.

It's best practice to require for password reset when a User logs in with those credentials for the first time.

Next, we Set Permissions.
Permissions can be from a Group. This means the User inherits the Group permissions.
Permissions can be copied from an existing User.
Permissions can be attached directly. This is called an Inline policy. I'd attach a policy using a JSON script for admin access.

Under Permission Boundary, you can select the maximum number of permissions a user can have. This is optional.

You can also Tag the User with a Key Value Pair that provides metadata about the user.

Review the User details and Create a User.

Download the CSV file containing the access keys and Secret ID if you have User Programmatic access.

You can send the User an email containing their Username and URL to sign in.
